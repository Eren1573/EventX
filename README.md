The project **EventX** is designed to be highly flexible and scalable, catering to a diverse range of event types and sizes. While we want to be able to handle anything, our initial focus for the MVP will be on a specific market to ensure we solve a core problem exceptionally well before expanding.

Primary Target Audience for MVP:

Organizers: Hackathon organizers, primarily at the university and corporate level. This group is tech-savvy, values seamless collaboration, and is acutely aware of the shortcomings of existing platforms. They need powerful, intuitive tools for managing participants, submissions, and judging.

Participants: University students and young professionals. They are highly motivated by opportunities to build a portfolio, learn new skills, and network. They are accustomed to digital-first experiences and will expect a clean, fast, and highly engaging user interface.

Sponsors: Tech companies and startups. Their primary goal is talent acquisition and brand promotion. They need a platform that provides a direct, measurable return on investment, with features for lead generation, targeted engagement, and robust analytics.

Future Expansion: Once the MVP is established, we can broaden the scope to include:

Large corporate conferences and industry summits.

Creative "ideathons" and design challenges.

Hybrid events with both physical and virtual components.

Educational workshops and professional development series.

2. Core Problem with Existing Solutions (Unstop, Devfolio, etc.)
Based on the project description, the key frustrations with current platforms like Unstop and Devfolio that "EventX" aims to solve are:

Fragmentation and Manual Workflows: Organizers often have to use multiple tools for different parts of an event (e.g., one platform for registration, a different one for team formation, and another for communication). This leads to a clunky user experience, data silos, and a significant administrative burden. EventX will be an all-in-one platform.

Lack of Intelligent Matching and Personalization: Current platforms offer limited to no intelligent matchmaking for participants. Participants are often left to find teams manually, which can be a major barrier to entry and a source of frustration. Sponsors also lack sophisticated tools for identifying and engaging with the most relevant talent. EventX will leverage AI for this.

Static, Un-engaging Virtual Experiences: Virtual events on existing platforms often feel like glorified video calls with limited interactivity. They fail to replicate the dynamism and networking opportunities of in-person events. EventX will use VR/AR to create truly immersive environments.

Poor Analytics and ROI Measurement: Sponsors and organizers struggle to get deep, actionable insights into attendee behavior, engagement levels, and the true ROI of their involvement. They often rely on manual data collection and guesswork. EventX will provide robust, real-time analytics.

Limited Customization and Branding: Organizers have a hard time creating a unique, branded experience that truly reflects their event's identity. Platforms can feel generic and restrictive. EventX will offer powerful customization tools.

3. Initial MVP Focus
Given the ambitious feature set, a successful MVP for EventX will need to focus on the core user journey and the most significant differentiators.

Must-Have Features for MVP (Hackathon-centric):

Core Event Management: A unified dashboard for organizers to manage the event timeline, set up challenges, and oversee participant registration and submissions.

AI-Powered Team Matching: A key differentiator. This feature will use participant profiles (skills, interests, project ideas) to intelligently recommend potential teammates.
